# My Blog

The code for my blog, this readme is mostly for myself for when I inevitably stop working on this blog for a bit and forget how I set it up.

## Notes

- After cloning this repo also need to run the following line to pull the submodules (themes)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
