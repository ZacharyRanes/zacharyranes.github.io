It is worth look back at old games, many are still worth playing

Remakes and official emulated games are a good way to experience old games, but they also have significant downfalls that would make play a game this way as your first time playing it a bad experience, maybe one that even source you on the idea of retro games.

Some old games really do show their age, Romhacks and fan patches are great ways to make it possible to play older games with some more modern touches. Emulators may seem like a daunting thing but with less than 30 minutes of reading you should be able to set one up without much effort.
