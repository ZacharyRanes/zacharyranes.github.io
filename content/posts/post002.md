The term homelab in general refers to someoneâ€™s collection of servers and or networking equipment that they use to practice concepts and technologies for programming, networking, and system admiration. Practicing at home is often needed because true trial and error is not feasible at work. The benefit of a homelab is the ability to break it with little to no consequence, which lets you learn from mistakes in a low threat environment. In this line of thought I would causation against using your personal computer as part of your homelab, or at least not install and testing software on it, that way if and when you break something you main computing device is saved the trauma.
