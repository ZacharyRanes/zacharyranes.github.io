## Why

I am a firm believer that you need to make mistakes to learn, but with a lot of IT jobs makes a mistake mean bring down a server or network, which is not an acceptable cost to learn what key not to press. However not experimenting at all leads to an IT worker that don’t really know their job or equipment. Worse yet if this kind of mentality is internalized it can lead to an IT worker that does not even attempt to fix anything but the most critical of errors, in fear that any change to the system will lead to a new error they are not equipped to solve.

## How

The term homelab in general refers to someone’s collection of servers and or networking equipment that they use to practice concepts and technologies for programming, networking, and system admiration. The benefit of a homelab is the ability to break it with little to no consequence, which lets you learn from mistakes in a low threat environment.

## What

I would causation against thinking of your personal computer as part of your homelab that way if and when you break something you main computing device is saved the trauma.
